# Old Projects

This is a bunch of veryyy old projects from 2015/2016/2017 that I created when learning how to program.

Just thought it would be interesting to share what I have found on old hardrives etc

Source code is mostly untouched. The only modifications is that I fixed any errors that would not allow them to work.

## C++

I added CMakeLists and build scripts to all of these. See the project README files for more information.
